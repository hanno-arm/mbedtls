The files `test_file.sig` and `test_file.sig_bad[1-5]` have been generated by PKCS1-v15-SHA256-signing `test_file` with
the RSA private key in `test_file_rsakey.txt`. The RSA key is stored in non-PKCS format output by `programs/pkey/gen_key`,
and the signatures have been generated by `programs/pkey/rsa_sign`, with the following modifications to the code get the
desired malformed signatures: For `test_file.sig`, no modification has been done, and the signature is valid. For
`test_file.sig_bad1`, the ASN.1 sequence for `DigestInfo` (see documentation of `mbedtls_rsa_rsassa_pkcs1_v15_sign` in
`rsa.c`) has a non-reduced 1-byte length encoding; for `test_file.sig_bad2`, the ASN.1 sequence for `digestAlgorithm`
has non-reduced 2-byte length encoding; for `test_file.sig_bad3`, the optional parameters of the ASN.1
`digestAlgorithm` have non-reduced 3-byte length encoding; for `test_file.sig_bad4`, the ASN.1 octet string `Digest` has
non-reduced 4-byte length encoding; for `test_file.sig_bad5`, the ASN.1 OID identifier `digestAlgorithm` has non-reduced
3-byte length encoding.

The contents of `test_file.sig` and `test_file.sig_bad[1-5]` are used in the tests `RSA PKCS1 Verify v1.5 reduced length
encoding` and `RSA PKCS1 Verify v1.5 non-reduced length encoding #[1-5]` in the RSA test suite.
